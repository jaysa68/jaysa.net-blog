trying to figure out what car i want

<!-- more -->

I loved my 2015 chevrolet malibu. Made it 6 years, got me through highschool.

But that car got totaled by some guy with no license while my mom was driving
it to the Christmas Fair. It's time to hunt. For a new car, not the guy.

Priorities:
- MINIMAL TECH
    - if there is a screen, most things (radio + ac) should be also available w/ physical buttons
    - no features that matter should require a touch screen
- small
    - easy to park
    - good maneuverability
- steers and takes turns well
- moddable. possible mods:
    - wrap, subwoofer, underglow
    - exhaust
    - dark tint
    - coilovers
    - dash cam, backup cam
    - tires
    - maybe engine swap? if i feel itd be good
- swag

Preferables:
- convertible
