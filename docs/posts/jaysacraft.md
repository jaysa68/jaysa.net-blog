## How to Join?

1. Ask me (contact@jaysa.net) or a server operator to add you to the whitelist.
1. Download and launch Prismlauncher.
1. In Prismlauncher, click  "Add Instance".
1. Select Neoforge under modloader, set 1.21.1 as the version, then click "OK".
    - You can right-click and rename the instance if you'd like.
1. Unzip the modpack. 
1. On the instance you made, click "Edit" -> "Mods" -> "Add File".
1. Get to the folder where you unzipped the mods and select all of them, then click "OK".
1. Double click the instance to start it!
1. Then, in multiplayer, join IP `minecraft.jaysa.net`.
1. Once you're on, please install the recommended resource pack, and grab the recommended shaders linked above if you have a decent computer.

You can also use Modrinth or the default launcher instead of Prismlauncher.

## Can I invite my friends?

Yeah, but you're on the hook if they do any griefing. Ask an operator to whitelist them: `/whitelist add USERNAME`.

Server operators:

    - `venomshank68` (jaysa)
    - `gureatest` (thalia)

## I need help!

Reach out to me on discord (evil_girl_making_laggy_chairs) or email me at [contact@jaysa.net](mailto:contact@jaysa.net).

## What's the resource pack?

The server should prompt you to install this pack on joining. If you want to download it manually, use the link below.
