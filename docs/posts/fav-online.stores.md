# favorite online stores

I've personally purchased from each of these at least once and want to recommend them to others.

<!--- more --->

1. [neogeopet](https://www.neogeopet.com/)

Just so damn cute!! Plus, the sheets contain stickers that are a great size for small objects. You can get [any of these bunnies](https://neogeo.pet/bunny) as a sticker... so... just saying.

2. [carmico](https://carmico.ca/)

I've bought a ton of things from them. Even if something is out of stock, they do restock occasionally; I waited patiently for them to restock the death's head moth bag for a year and got it.

3. [hellsent](https://www.hellsent.us)

good stuff. nsfw.

4. [mooncat](https://www.mooncat.com/)

This is the only brand I buy nail polish from at the moment. I will probably make a dedicated post about nails that will talk about mooncat at length. Every single color has been fantastic. It has a dedicated subreddit if you'd like to see examples beyond the photos on the website: [r/mooncat](https://www.reddit.com/r/mooncatpolish/)

5. [Holo Taco](https://www.holotaco.com/)

I bought a lot of nail polish from Holo Taco before I found mooncat. They have a different style from mooncat but are still pretty. I recommend their Unicorn Skin flakies in particular. You'll probably want a separate solid color to go underneath the flakies, though.

6. [Framework](https://frame.work/)

My Framework 13 has been a great college laptop, and I would recommend the brand to most people, even non-tech enthusiasts. No, it isn't the best bang-for-your-buck option at first glance. But when you inevitably damage the display, or need to upgrade your RAM, you can easily purchase replacement parts and follow their extensive repair guides using the single screwdriver that comes with the laptop. You don't have to take it to a repair shop and you don't have to buy a new laptop for basic changes.

Repairability and upgradability is something that's rare in many products today, and unfortunately it's not just tech. But if you prioritize these qualities when looking for a laptop yourself, although you're just one person, you help create demand for user-friendly laptops that we don't have to toss in the trash so quickly :)
