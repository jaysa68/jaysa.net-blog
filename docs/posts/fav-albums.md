# Top Albums

For most artists, I just like one or a few songs. It's even rarer that I enjoy an entire album. I prefer to make playlists. But sometimes each song on an album grows on me, slowly but surely, until I can enjoy the entire thing. These are some albums where that happened for me.

The further up an album is, the more I love it.

    Best for driving around at night. Most of these songs taste like Mike's Hard Lemonade. Each track is either Toxic Relationship (sad) or Toxic Relationship (hot). Yet it's all so cohesive... if I'm in the mood for just one of these songs, the rest come naturally. I'm slightly partial to the (hot) songs, though: "BORED", "SWITCHBLADE", "TEETH", "DARK", and "SPINE". Very tied to December 2024.

    I don't condone speeding or swerving down empty roads in the dark. But if you do, turn up the heat and roll down your windows to feel the air.

    The first time that I watched the Red Wine Supernova music video, I thought that Chappell Roan and the magician girl were the same person. The red hair confused me. Then I found "HOTTOGO", the best song for being out on a hundred-degree day. I had it on all of summer 2024.

    I adore how detailed the music videos are. The desperate pose where Chappell hugs his legs in "My Kink is Karma", and how her outfits become increasingly sea-themed the longer she's with the siren in "Casual". "Coffee" captures that cyclical, slippery, and broken long-term relationship so well that I tear up every time I play it.
