## 1. Sunscreen

I use Canmake Mermaid Skin Gel in [01] Clear. Unlike every other item which I will list, this is a Japanese product you won't find this at CVS or Walgreens. I usually buy enough off of their English website at once to get free shipping, or find it in a J-beauty store.

I don't know if it does much in terms of anti-aging or hyperpigmentation, but this sunscreen makes my face soft and look shiny. I also use retinol at night for acne, which makes my skin more sensitive to sun, so using sunscreen is probably for the better. I cannot be bothered to reapply throughout the day, though.

## 2. Eyeshadow

I like Sephora's single pan eyeshadow in the shade Coffee Break, but any dark brown eyeshadow works. I ran out of that recently, so I've been using some old Maybelline palette from Walgreens. I can't recommend the Maybelline eyeshadow, however... it creases very badly, and is so pigmented that it always goes on messily and darker than I'd like. 

I use a small eyeshadow brush to put the brown on the corners of my upper eye. I take it a bit further into the crease but not past the middle. Blending this out is very important! It's time consuming, but helps the eyeshadow not look like a funky smudge.

Then, I use an angled eyeshadow brush in the same brown to follow straight across my lower lash line once. I blend this out a bit with my finger, or go over one side an extra time if it looks lighter than the other. I go just below my waterline because leaving it light makes my eyes look bigger.

## 3. Liquid Eyeliner

For this part, I use Nyx Epic Ink Waterproof Liquid Eyeliner. Don't think I've ever used another brand, since this does it perfectly.

I don't do a wing. I only go directly along my upper lash line a few times, and I'm careful to not go past the corner. I try to get this line even and not too thick. If a little bit goes too high, I go in with a piece of a tissue soaked in makeup remover and try not to pick up any eyeshadow or anything more than the uneven bit.

The line gets thinner towards my inner eye so it doesn't quite reach the inner corner. I try to get the starting point and thickness even on both sides.

## 4. Mascara

I've tried a few mascaras, but I always come back to L'Oreal Lash Paradise. The fullness is unmatched.

On each eye, I count 15 swipes on the upper lashes, dip it in the tube, and then do 15 more. The slower you go, the better. I try to blink into each swipe. I'll make sure to get all of my eyelashes but I focus the outer edge more. After counting to 30, I use the tip of the wand on last few lashes at the edge of my eye and make sure they're coated... when those are thicker, it creates a cute look. It's easy to mess up and get it on my eyelid, though, so I have to be slow and careful.

If I notice my mascara getting more difficult to apply and I'm struggling to avoid clumps, it's time to buy a new one. This happens after a few months.

## 5. Tinted Lip Balm

I use Canmake's Stay-On Balm Rouge in the shade [09] Masquerade Bud. I'll buy this while I'm buying their sunscreen, since it also can't be found at drugstores. The small amount of red tint is really nice!

I do find I need to re-apply it every few hours, but I just carry it around with me instead of my old favorite Cake Batter ChapStick. If this Canmake balm had that cake batter flavor, the world would be perfect. But for now I prioritize aesthetics.

## Bonus: Makeup Remover

I used Vaseline on my eyes as a teenager, until I realized actual makeup remover is so much better. Now I use the Rose Water version of Garnier Micellar Water. I think the pink color and rose scent are cute, and the price is the same as the regular version.

If I'm not thorough removing eye makeup, I will have bad skin and possibly acne around my eyes the next day. If I'm too rough, a few of my eyelashes fall out. I just have to be very liberal with the amount of makeup remover I soak into the tissue (cottonballs work better, but I never bother to buy them). Also, I try to let it sit on my eye rather than rubbing them hard. Some rubbing is required, but I keep it to a minimum for the sake of my eyelashes.
