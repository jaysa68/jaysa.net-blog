# favorite online stores

<img src="/assets/fav-online-stores/collection.jpg" />

I've personally purchased from each of these and I recommend them to others.

<!-- more -->

## 1. [Neogeopet](https://www.neogeopet.com/)

<img src="/assets/fav-online-stores/neogeopet.jpg" />

Just so damn cute!! Plus, the sheets contain stickers that are a great size for small objects. You can get [any of these bunnies](https://neogeo.pet/bunny) as a sticker... so... just saying.

You can also follow [@neogeo.pet](https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:vjv2d4jjbbsd5pnmem77q55y) on bluesky to see more of their art and get notified when they're dropping something new in the shop (I use RSS for this because I don't have a bluesky account).

## 2. [Carmico](https://carmico.ca/)

<img src="/assets/fav-online-stores/carmico.jpg" />

I've bought a ton of things from here. Even if something is out of stock, they do restock occasionally. I waited patiently for them to restock the death's head moth bag for a year and got it.

## 3. [meide](https://meidestudio.co/)

<img src="/assets/fav-online-stores/meide.jpg" />

Unique designs. Great jewelry. Silver has a shine to it that stainless
steel doesn't replicate, so it's worth the money for me.

I think my custom *@jaysa.net email domain flagged me as spam once, so my order got cancelled. But I emailed them and they fixed it.

I actually watched Mei Yan's makeup tutorials on youtube when I was young
and loved them, even though I'm not Chinese, so they didn't really apply to
me lol. Except for having uneven eyelids... this is a defect that
unfortunately transcends race. Anyway, I'm happy that she's so successful
now :D

## 4. [mooncat](https://www.mooncat.com/)

<img src="/assets/fav-online-stores/mooncat.jpg" />

This is the only brand I buy nail polish from at the moment. Every single color I have is fantastic. I will make a dedicated post about nails later that will talk about mooncat at length. Also, it has a dedicated subreddit if you'd like to see examples beyond the photos on the website: [r/mooncat](https://www.reddit.com/r/mooncatpolish/)

## 6. [Framework](https://frame.work/)

<img src="/assets/fav-online-stores/framework.jpg" />

My Framework 13 has been a great college laptop and I would recommend the brand
to most people, even non-tech enthusiasts. It isn't the best bang-for-your-buck
option at first glance. But when you inevitably damage the display, or need to
upgrade your RAM, or make any other tweak to your computer, you can easily
purchase replacement parts and follow their extensive repair guides using the
single screwdriver that comes with the laptop. You don't have to take it to a
repair shop and you don't have to buy a new laptop for basic changes.

Repairability and upgradability is something that's rare in many products today, and unfortunately that's not just in tech. But if you prioritize these qualities when looking for a laptop yourself, although you're just one person, you help create demand for user-friendly laptops that we don't have to toss in the trash so quickly.

## 5. [Hellsent](https://www.hellsent.us)

good stuff. nsfw.

## 6. [Nordic Gnome](https://www.etsy.com/shop/NORDIKatja)

<img src="/assets/fav-online-stores/nordicgnome.jpg" />

Owned by my friend's girlfriend's friend's mom. Handmade gnomes. The beards are soft. You can even buy little hats for your gnome. 

## 7. [Largo Modern](https://www.etsy.com/shop/LargoModern)

<img src="/assets/fav-online-stores/largomodern.jpg" />

Tufted rugs :O

I got a regular one, but they do also make custom rugs.

## 6. [Holo Taco](https://www.holotaco.com/)

<img src="/assets/fav-online-stores/holotaco.jpg" />

I bought a lot of nail polish from Holo Taco before I found mooncat. They
have a different style from mooncat but the polishes are still pretty. I recommend their
Unicorn Skin flakies in particular. You'll probably want a separate solid
color to go underneath the flakies, though.

Holotaco also has a dedicated subreddit that I find useful: [r/holotaco](https://www.reddit.com/r/holotaco/)
