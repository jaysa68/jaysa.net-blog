And crying out

Stuck with the sun in your face

Staring deep into the ground

Pain in each territory of your body

With no known source; it doesn't matter

You don't have time.

</br>

The world moves quickly

And you? You drag your feet

But you do not hear the sound.

I'll put a hole through you

Your curly hair and tight smile.

</br>

I'll put a hole through you
