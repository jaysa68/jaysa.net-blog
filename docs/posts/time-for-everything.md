# Time For Everything


![desk](/assets/desk.webp)

<!-- more -->

Occasionally, I dread the fact that I do not have the time to do everything. There are only so many movies I can watch, books I can read, video games I can play, before I die. I will only get to a small fraction of them all. I will only work so many jobs and meet so many people. I become distressed over this thought and nervous that I won't pick the right ones. I wish I could live forever, until I've had my fill of everything.

But I suppose I only feel this way because I'm young. Perhaps when I'm old and close to death this anxiety will persist, stronger than ever. Or maybe I will feel tired and ready. Sort of like how you get this burst of energy late at night and you're ready to finish every project, focus and do it all, and can't imagine sleepiness ever setting in. Yet when early morning dawns, you slow down. You didn't get everything done, not all that you'd hoped, but you did a lot nonetheless. You don't feel like finishing it all anymore. Nothing sounds better than warmth, and rest, and crawling into bed.

I hope it will feel something like that.
